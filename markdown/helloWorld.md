# Hello, World!

Before someone says it, this is a joke. I am aware that markdown is not a programming language and is instead a [markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language). I just wanted to include it since I'm using html too since I need to learn html (html is also a markup language, I just need to remember the syntax)
